\section{New Implementation}

The pre-existing algorithm operates as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Feed the data into the file \texttt{train.py} and process it using \texttt{nugraph/data}.
    \item \texttt{train.py} configures the model \texttt{NuGraph.py} according to the input parameters.
\end{itemize}
